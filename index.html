<h2>About Self Driving Cars</h2>

    <h2>Technology:</h2>
    <h2>LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):</h2>
   <div style="width: 100%">
    <p> LIDAR is a sensing technology that measures the distance by illuminating an object with a light beam and analyzes the reflected light. This is used to map its surroundings in 3D. LIDAR uses laser, ultraviolet light or infrared to detect objects. After the light returns to the car, the light is captured by the receiver and turned into data that can be used to create the 3D map of its environment. The wavelength of light is so small that this method of sensing is able to create detailed maps of the area around the car. Also it is able to reflect off of all types of materials so the car will be able to see everything around it.</p></div>

    <h2>RADAR(Radio Detection and Ranging):</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>RADAR is used to determine the speeds that other vehicles and the self driving car itself is driving. Like LIDAR, RADAR sends out a signal and waits for it to return after reflecting off of the objects around it. This signal is then used with the LIDAR to add more data to better understand its surroundings. The RADAR systems are mostly used for detecting oncoming vehicles, self parking, blind spot detection, lane-change assistance, impact warnings, and cross-traffic alerts.</p></div>

    <h2>Video Cameras:</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Video cameras are used to give more context to the mapping that the LIDAR creates. The cameras are able to pick up the images on road signs and are able to detect other things like animals or people. The cameras help in recognising things that you would not be able to see on the other sensors or other things the sensors can not comprehend. </p></div>

    <h2>GPS(Global Positioning System):</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>GPS is a space based satellite navigation system. It provides current information of your location anywhere on earth at any time. The GPS system in the car is able to tell the main computer where it is and is able to keep the vehicle on its intended track. The use of GPS is crucial for the vehicle to be able to drive to a location without human input.</p></div>

    <h2>Pros and Cons:</h2>
    <h2>Pros:</h2>
    <h3>Less Human Error</h3>
   <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>By reducing human involvement in driving, the occurrence of errors and accidents can be significantly minimized. 94% of severe crashes are attributed to human error. With the absence of human drivers, the frequency of accidents caused by distractions or other human fallibilities will be substantially diminished.</p></div>

    <h3>Reduced Traffic</h3>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Another aspect of human error pertains to traffic congestion. However, the advent of self-driving cars presents a promising solution, as they possess the capability to engage incommunication with other vehicles on the road, thereby attaining knowledge of the whereabouts of every automobile. Human drivers often have abrupt accelerations and decelerations, contributing to the occurrence of traffic jams. Self-driving cars can maintain a consistent speed by using their understanding of other vehicles' speeds, ensuring safe and efficient driving conditions. This will also let the self-driving cars travel at faster speeds.</p></div>

    <h2>Cons:</h2>
    <h3>Technological Error</h3>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>While self-driving cars can improve safety by limiting human error, there can still be technology that fails. The sensors and cameras that self-driving cars use are not always 100% reliable. There have been many cases of them not being able to correctly identify things like other cars and pedestrians causing crashes and even death. There will always be new technology coming out and that means there will always be some unseen problems.</p></div>

    <h3>Unpredictable Traffic and Speed</h3>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>While self-driving cars can improve traffic there could still be some downsides. The traffic patterns could be totally unpredictable and unsafe if a car needs to pull over. There can be abnormal things that happen on the road and a  self-driving car may not know what to do about it and could cause a crash. Also with the speed of the cars being faster if they are able to communicate with each other, there would be higher impact crashes causing even more damage and injuries. </p></div>
