<h1>Autonomy/Data</h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="autonomy">
    <h2>Levels of Autonomy:</h2>
    <h2>Level 0</h2>
   <div style="width: 100%">
    <p> Level 0 represents the absence of driving automation, with the majority of vehicles on the road today falling into this category. In level 0, all driving tasks are performed by humans, although there may be certain systems in place to aid drivers, such as emergency braking. As the vehicle does not possess the capability to drive itself, it does not qualify as a self-driving vehicle.</p></div>

    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Level 1 involves driver assistance, which marks the lowest level of automation. At this stage, there is a singular system implemented to assist with driving tasks. This could include features like steering assistance, cruise control, or adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe distance from vehicles ahead. Level 1 automation still requires human monitoring of steering or braking, as drivers are not in direct control.</p></div>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Level 2 introduces partial driving automation, denoting vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems. In this level, the vehicle can take charge of both steering and acceleration. However, level 2 automation still necessitates human intervention, as drivers can reclaim control whenever necessary. Tesla Autopilot is an example of level 2 autonomy. </p></div>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Level 3 signifies conditional driving automation, where vehicles possess environmental detection capabilities and can make decisions based on their surroundings. While level 3 automation still relies on human commands, drivers must remain seated and ready to assume control if the situation warrants it. </p></div>

    <h2>Level 4</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Level 4 characterizes high driving automation. The key distinction between level 3 and level 4 is that, in level 4, when the system encounters a task it cannot complete, it will intervene and rectify the problem autonomously. As a result, human interference is not necessary, although humans retain the ability to assume control of the vehicle if required. </p></div>

    <h2>Level 5</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%">
    <p>Level 5 represents full driving automation, where vehicles operate without any need for human interaction. In level 5, the vehicle is entirely in control, devoid of steering wheels or accelerators. This level of automation does not offer any option for human intervention. While level 5 vehicles are not yet available to the general public worldwide, they are currently undergoing testing in various regions across the globe. </p></div>

      <h2>Why they Collect Data</h2>
    </div>
      <p style="text-align: left">Self-driving vehicles employ a range of cutting-edge sensors, such as radar, cameras, and internal measurement systems, to collect valuable data that enhances their decision-making capabilities and improves their perception of the environment. This data acquisition process is crucial for refining the performance of these autonomous machines. By continuously gathering information from their surroundings, self-driving vehicles enable their machine learning algorithms to become more efficient and adaptable by exposing them to a diverse range of real-world scenarios.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">One of the primary purposes for self-driving cars to collect data is perception and object recognition. The information they acquire while navigating enables them to gain an understanding of their surroundings, helping them to make well-informed decisions. By analyzing the data received from sensors, self-driving cars can accurately identify and classify objects, such as pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs,  enhancing their ability to navigate safely and effectively.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">Another key reason for data collection is mapping. Self-driving vehicles extensively observe and record the roads they traverse to build detailed maps. By documenting the characteristics of various routes, including lane markings, traffic signals, and geographical features, these vehicles can develop a thorough understanding of the roads they have encountered. This mapping process enables self-driving cars to possess prior knowledge of a given route when they traverse it again, facilitating better route planning and maneuvering.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">The data collected by self-driving cars contributes significantly to safety. Manufacturers can analyze the behavior of the vehicles based on the acquired data, allowing them to evaluate the vehicle's perception of the surrounding environment. This analysis provides crucial insights into areas that require improvement, helping manufacturers enhance the safety of self-driving cars and ensure compliance with established safety standards. By continuously monitoring and evaluating the vehicle's performance through data analysis, manufacturers can proactively identify and address potential issues, further bolstering the safety of self-driving technology on the roads.</p>
