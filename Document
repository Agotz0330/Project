Document Explaining Implementation
Usability: I think that the useability of my website is pretty simple for people to use without any additional instructions. The bar at the top helps to navigate through the website and there are buttons that take you to the games that are pretty easy to figure out as well. I think I should get most if not full points for this aspect.

Educational Value- I think that there is a lot of information on my website about my topic. I think that each section will teach the user something new and will teach each of my personas something new and hopefully the games will help them remember something as well. I think I should get most of the points for this section.

Interactivity- I think that switching between the pages and the games are good for interactivity and will enhance the users experience. I think that the games in the site do a good job of creating interaction for the users.I think I should get most of the points for this section.

Aesthetics- I think that my site looks pretty good. I wanted each page to have a similar feel and design. I think that my layout was good at showing the information in an easy to read and understand way. I think I should get most of the points for this section
